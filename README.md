# Angular App with Tensorflow.js integration

1. First step is to search on wikipedia for a page, then a page needs to be selected
2. Ask a question on the selected content
3. Get a prediction, the model is limited - you will not get an answer to every question. The model is loaded from the tensorflow hub, depending on your internet connection this may take a while.
